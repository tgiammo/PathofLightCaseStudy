        <h2>Prepare yourself for savasana</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your
            side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the
            mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use
            your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your
            hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
